# üê¢ Turtle Graphics - Mega Grid of Colorful Squares

Welcome to the **Turtle Graphics** project! This fun and interactive program uses Python's turtle graphics module to draw a stunning grid of colorful squares. Dive in and watch the turtle create beautiful patterns right before your eyes! üåà‚ú®

## üé® Features

- **Vibrant Colors**: Randomly selects from a list of vibrant colors (`red`, `cyan`, `yellow`, `green`, `pink`, `purple`) to fill each square.
- **Dynamic Grid**: Draws a 4x4 grid of squares, creating a mesmerizing mosaic of colors.
- **Interactive Drawing**: Watch as the turtle moves and draws in real-time, making each execution a unique visual experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (usually included with Python's standard library)

### Installation

No special installation is required! Just make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### Running the Program

1. Save the code below in a file named `turtle_graphics.py`.

    ```python
    import turtle
    import random

    colour = ['red', 'cyan', 'yellow', 'green', 'pink', 'purple']

    bob = turtle.Turtle()

    def shift():
        bob.pu()
        bob.fd(200)
        bob.lt(90)
        bob.pd()

    def square():
        bob.fillcolor(random.choice(colour))
        bob.begin_fill()
        for i in range(4):
            bob.fd(100)
            bob.lt(90)
        bob.end_fill()

    def grid():
        for i in range(4):
            square()
            shift()

    def megaGrid():
        grid()
        bob.pu()
        bob.lt(180)
        bob.fd(200)
        bob.rt(180)
        bob.pd()
        grid()
        bob.pu()
        bob.rt(90)
        bob.fd(200)
        bob.lt(90)
        bob.pd()
        grid()
        bob.pu()
        bob.fd(200)
        bob.pd()
        grid()
        bob.lt(180)
        bob.fd(200)
        bob.rt(180)

    megaGrid()

    turtle.mainloop()
    ```

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your `turtle_graphics.py` file is saved.

3. Run the program using Python:
    ```bash
    python turtle_graphics.py
    ```

4. Sit back and enjoy the colorful display! üåü

## ü§î How It Works

- **`square` Function**: This function draws a single square and fills it with a random color.
- **`shift` Function**: This function moves the turtle to the next position to draw the next square without drawing a line.
- **`grid` Function**: This function draws a row of 4 squares, shifting the turtle after each square.
- **`megaGrid` Function**: This function orchestrates the drawing of a 4x4 grid by calling the `grid` function multiple times and adjusting the turtle's position accordingly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Feel free to play around with the code:
- Add more colors to the `colour` list.
- Adjust the size of the squares.
- Modify the grid layout or size.

Unleash your creativity and make the grid uniquely yours!
